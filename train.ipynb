            "Question:  is television a gendered medium? given the prevalence of cop shows and male anti-heroes that characterize “peak” or quality tv (both past and present), many would assume that television is a “masculine” medium, made up of “masculine” genres. however, the history of television says otherwise. this course traces the numerous ways that television—as an institution, an industry, a narrative form, and a social space—becomes aligned with various notions of gender, in the form of femininity, domesticity, feminism, “women’s culture,” and the female consumer, all at different historical moments. what these different historical moments do share, however, is the assumption that the female television viewer is always coded as white, middle class, cisgender, and able-bodied. to examine how representations of gender have taken shape on television, we will study television chronologically, spanning television sitcoms and soap operas of the 1950s and 1960s, to the rise of feminist television (julia, the mary tyler moore show) in the 1970s, to images of “working women” in the 1980s and 90s. in the final weeks of the seminar, we will discuss the rise of streaming television, “narrowcasting,” and contemporary attempts of intersectionality on television—and how new forms of television have created new ways of thinking about gender.\n",

            "Question:  in recent years, we have seen a virtual explosion of writing by women, with women’s novels constituting some of the most widely read and critically admired work being produced today. the global reach of both its authors and audiences has made contemporary women’s writing a truly international phenomenon. we will examine what makes this work especially innovative: its experimentation with new voices and narrative forms and its blurring of genre boundaries. we will look at the dialogue it has established with the past, where it often finds its inspiration, self-consciously appropriating earlier literary texts or rewriting history. we will also consider what special challenges this work poses for its readers. looking at works originating in a wide range of locations, this course, will explore the diverse shapes of contemporary women's imagination and attempt to account for the compelling interest of this new body of fiction.\n",

            "Question:  rochester’s history began long before the first permanent settlement in 1812 and was marked by a long and violent conflict between native peoples, the french and the british.   wheat harvested in the genesee valley was ground into flour using the power of the genesee river as it dropped 260 feet to lake ontario.   transporting flour and other goods to new york city and other markets was difficult until the erie canal was completed in 1825.  the canal enabled an enormous migration of settlers moving west, and many chose to stay in rochester.  the village became a city in 1834 with a vibrant and expanding mix of cultures that joined together to make rochester a vibrant commercial and manufacturing center.  the western union telegraph company traces its roots to rochester in 1851 and in 1853 eight local new york railroads merged to form the new york central, whose tracks ran parallel to the erie canal.   in 1881 a local bank clerk, george eastman, quit his job to devote his full attention to the business of photography and founded the eastman kodak company.  the haloid photographic company was founded in rochester in 1906 and entered into an agreement with inventor chester carlson in 1946 that resulted in the introduction of the xerox 914 plain paper copy machine in 1959 was adopted around the world.   nevertheless, rochester’s most famous residents are likely frederick douglass and susan b. anthony, who were instrumental in the struggle to expand civil rights to all americans.  the local community, however, struggled to welcome the large numbers of african americans who moved to rochester after world war ii.  housing discrimination, white flight to the suburbs, and riots marked the 1960s, and the city today has one of the highest rates of child poverty in the country.  nevertheless, the city has vibrant cultural and educational institutions that continue to attract talented newcomers.  in short, the history of rochester has a bit of everything and students in the course are encouraged to study the entire experience of the community, including topics that may be new and frankly uncomfortable. \n",

            "Question:  is american democracy under threat? what about democracy in the west, or the world more generally? how can we detect if democracies are eroding? democratic erosion is a new upper-level undergraduate seminar, based on a cross-university collaboration, which is aimed at evaluating threats to democracy both in the united states and abroad through the lens of theory, history and social science. importantly, the class is not intended as a partisan critique, but rather teaches students how to answer questions about democratic erosion using both analytical and empirical tools. note: course not open to first-year students.\n",

            "Question:  buildings are among the most public, visible, and long lived artifacts that a culture creates.  the built environment serves as both a repository of cultural information and exerts an influence that extends beyond the society that created it.  architecture is art in a physical, three dimensional reality; it responds to the limitations of technology, design, and space while materializing ideals of aesthetics and beauty.  famous designers, trained architects, anonymous craftspeople, and laypeople alike create architectural forms. this studio art course will introduce the ways in which we design, create, study, and convey architecture.  we will investigate practices of architectural design, history, building craft, and engineering in this class through lectures, research, in-class exercises, and thematic assignments.  the course will culminate with a fully realized design for a small building of your own invention.  this course will challenge you to recognize precedent forms and to create designs of your own, from sketch to 3d model making, that explore basic design elements.  skills explored in this course can be used to gain a better understanding of the built world around us and pursue further studies in architecture.this course is open to all majors, and prior architecture study is not required. if the course fills and you would like to be added to the waitlist, fill out the form found at this link: https://www.sageart.center/resources.\n",

            "Question:  what makes popular nonfiction so compelling? the writer’s style? their voice? their eye for topics that often surprise us? and how can we successfully utilize those rhetorical strategies in our own writing? in this course, we’ll take a deep dive into popular nonfiction, analyzing how the way one writes affects what is learned, who the audience is, and how the text shapes the world. to explore these questions in action, we’ll look at post-1945 nonfiction writers like renegade journalist hunter s. thompson, conflicting chroniclers of the vietnam war michael herr and viet thanh nguyen, public intellectual ta-nehisi coates, and the “everymen” podcasters behind stuff you should know, seeing how these writers became famous, in part, for making their complex ideas profoundly engaging to the larger public. while we use these works to underpin our informal and formal writing assignments and discussion, we’ll also use them as models as we practice writing in styles which suit audiences from trained academics to casual readers. through peer feedback, reflection, and revision, you will develop writing skills fit for a variety of contexts, with your work culminating in an 8-10 page argumentative research paper integrating course themes and individual interests.to fulfill the primary writing requirement, a student must earn a grade of c or higher.\n",

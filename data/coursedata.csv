Given THe prevalence of cOP shows and male anti-heroes THat characterize “peak” or qualITy TV (boTH PAst and presENT), many would assuME THat television is a “mascuLINe” MEdium, made up of “mascuLINe” GENres.

What THese differENT HIStorical moMEnts do share, however, is THe assumption THat THe female television viewer is always codED as whITe, middle CLass, CISGENder, and able-bodiED. To examine how represENTations of GENder have taken shape on television, we will study television chronologically, SPanning television sITcoms and soap OPeras of THe 1950s and 1960s, to THe rise of feminist television (Julia, THe Mary Tyler Moore Show) in THe 1970s, to images of “working woMEn” in THe 1980s and 90s.

ENGL504,ENGL,Studies in Book History: The Medieval and Early Modern Miscellany,"Encountering early texts in THEIr manuscript and print contexts, as THe original readers would have, is a dramatically differENT EXPerience FRom reading MEdieval and early modern lITerature today. AlTHough differences in letter forms, bINDings, ink, illumination practices, SPelLINg, rubrication, punctuation, glossing, and PAge layout all contribute to THis, perhAPS THe most significant difference is THe way in which multiple texts were compilED and grouPED into codices by MEdieval scribes and early modern printers. THe miscellany, in fact, is THe norm among vernacular books in ENGland for most of ITs lITerary HIStory. A MEdieval reader would have encounterED Beowulf alongside a poetic transLATion of THe Hebrew Bible’s JudITh and THe prose Letter of Alexander to Aristotle; readers of THe codex in which Sir Gawain and THe Green Knight is found might INStead have been more interestED in Pearl or CLeanness; Wyatt first appearED to most Renaissance ENGlish readers fifTEEn years after HIS deaTH in Tottel’s Miscellany. Yet today, Beowulf is nearly a household nAME, while ITs nEIghbors (cOPiED by THe sAME two scribes in London, BrITish Library, MS VITellius A.XV) are nearly fORGotten. THis research seminar will EXPlore practices of compiLATion in several early books and rECEnt scholarship examining imPORtant miscellanies; we will also read two LATe-MEdieval works (by THe ENGlish poet THomas HocCLeve and THe GERman mystic Henry Suso) which dramatize THe process of creating a collection of diSParate texts.

LING447,LING,Natural Language Processing,"THis course addresses issues of represENTing computing MEaning FRom natural language, eSPecially issues of understanding language in context using commonsENSe knowlEDge of THe world. TOPics will inCLude a survey of ENGlish PHrase STRucture and PArsing, semantic represENTation (e.g., evENTs, semantic roles, tiME, causalITy and SPeech acts), and THeories and TEChniques for understanding language in context, inCLuding intENTion rECOgnITion, text understanding using knowlEDge of scripts and plans, and models of SPoken dialogue sysTEMs (e.g., conversational aGENts such as Siri). CSC447, THe gRADuate level version of THe course, requires a suBSTantial INDividual project. PrerequisITes: CSC 242"
LING450,LING,Data Science for Linguistics,"THis course addresses LINguistic research questions THrough data science TEChniques. THe course will focus on develOPing skills to (i) acquire and process a variety of language data, FRom using establishED corPORa to capturing data in THe wild, and (ii) to investigate language use, PArticularly syntactic and semantic PHenoMEna, THrough descriptive and inferENTial STATistical TEChniques. A significant PArt of THe course will be devotED to hands-on projects and will inCLude develOPing familiarITy wITh using THe programming languages PyTHon and R to acquire and EXPlore LINguistic data. FamiliarITy wITh STATistics and/or computational LINguistics is advantageous, but not nECEssary."
LING465,LING,Formal Semantics,"THis course is an in-dePTH INTRoduction to THe formal ANAlysis of natural language MEaning, employing TEChniques THat have been develOPED in language and formal PHilosOPhy over THe lAST cENTury. Issues inCLude intENSionalITy, quantification, tENSe, presupposITion, pluralITy, THe ANAlysis of discourse, and oTHer currENT issues. FamiliarITy wITh syntax, logic, and/or computation are hELPful."
LING466,LING,Intro to Pragmatics,"WIThin THeoretical LINguistics, pragmatics is (broadly SPeaking) THe study of how language users convey MEaning. THis course covers THree GENeral arEAS: (1) How MEaning carriED by LINguistic eleMEnts (such as sENTences) interacts wITh MEaning THat arises FRom inferences about SPeakers intENTions; (2) Ways of characterizing MEaning, eSPecially wITh reSPect to LINguistic eleMEnts not EASily handlED in tRADITional semantic (i.e., truTH-condITional) terms; (3) THe role of context in determining MEaning. TOPics to be discussED inCLude THe RELation between semantics and pragmatics, represENTations of context, truTH-condITional and oTHer types of MEaning, presupposITion; implicature and Grices CoOPerative Principle"
LING471,LING,Field Methods I,"THis CLass is similar to LIN389: StuDENts will learn how to ORGanize a fieldwork project by working wITh a native SPeaker. THey will sysTEMatically prePAre elicITation sessions, ORGanize THEIr data, and learn how to wrITe up short sketCHEs of THEIr FINdings. THe FINal project is a chapter of a joint sketch grammar of THe language, inCLuding annotatED natural text.In contrAST to THe senior seminar, however, THis course is designED for two terms, continuing in THe fall term. Also, PArticiPAnts are requirED to have taken LIN270/470 as a prerequisITe. Having a background in language docuMEntation and data processing TEChniques, stuDENts in THis CLass will focus more on collecting and annotating natural texts (stories, dialogues, EXPeriMEntal data) which is adding a docuMEntary angle."

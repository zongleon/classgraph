      <data key="d0">This course focuses on protest music in America during the 20th and 21st centuries. We will examine how music has been used throughout American history to articulate the social and political concerns of Americans. As we examine genres such as folk music, the blues, punk, rock ’n roll, hip hop, and funk, we will focus on how artists within each genre musically and verbally expressed the existential realities facing American culture. We will also look closely at specific social movements and political events - such as the labor movement, the civil rights movement, the Vietnam war, women's liberation, LGBTQ activism, and the Black Lives Matter Movement, among others - to understand how the music in each era impacted, and was impacted by, the American sociocultural milieu. </data>

We will focus largely on African American history in North America and the United States, but we will consider this history in the broader context of Black diasporic and Atlantic world history during this time period. The course will cover US Reconstruction’s rise and fall, the rise and fall of the Jim Crow regime, and the period of time bookended by the Civil Rights Movement and the Black Lives Matter uprisings of the past decade. We will focus especially on the question of Black self-determination: how Black American communities and individuals have historically defined and sought to achieve self-determination; how these definitions and struggles have both shaped and been shaped by the dominant political, economic, and social structures of the United States; and how these definitions and struggles have changed over time. The course will pay particular attention to the political, social, and cultural movements that defined these eras, and how these various movements challenged, contradicted, and/or shaped one another. We will focus especially on the ways that gender, class, sexuality, and nationalism shaped these movements. </data>

This co-taught course is a collaborative ethnographic research project designed to examine how the presence of prisons in towns around Rochester reflects and shapes the political, economic, and cultural lives of those who live in the region. Students will be introduced to methods and practices of ethnography and conduct firsthand research on the cultural politics of prison towns. Through assigned reading, students will learn about the history, sociology, and cultural logics of Rochester and the wider region, and of mass incarceration. What does a prison mean for a person living near one? How does the presence of prisons shape people’s notions of justice, citizenship, and punishment? How do these nearby but largely invisible institutions shape the ways that we live in Rochester? Recommended prior courses: Introduction to Cultural Anthropology or Incarceration Nation</data>

      <data key="d0">Is television a gendered medium? Given the prevalence of cop shows and male anti-heroes that characterize “peak” or quality TV (both past and present), many would assume that television is a “masculine” medium, made up of “masculine” genres. However, the history of television says otherwise. This course traces the numerous ways that television—as an institution, an industry, a narrative form, and a social space—becomes aligned with various notions of gender, in the form of femininity, domesticity, feminism, “women’s culture,” and the female consumer, all at different historical moments. What these different historical moments do share, however, is the assumption that the female television viewer is always coded as white, middle class, cisgender, and able-bodied. To examine how representations of gender have taken shape on television, we will study television chronologically, spanning television sitcoms and soap operas of the 1950s and 1960s, to the rise of feminist television (Julia, The Mary Tyler Moore Show) in the 1970s, to images of “working women” in the 1980s and 90s. In the final weeks of the seminar, we will discuss the rise of streaming television, “narrowcasting,” and contemporary attempts of intersectionality on television—and how new forms of television have created new ways of thinking about gender.</data>

This course departs from such sedimented notions, offering a critical introduction to the study of street art and graffiti, understood broadly as self-authorized interventions into public space. Building an interdisciplinary framework grounded in urban studies, anthropology, sociology, art history, and cultural studies, we will deploy a dialectical approach that considers street art and graffiti as site-specific visual artifacts and as performative practices with the potential to actively transform public space and reimagine everyday life. Visual objects such as photographic archives, zines, documentaries, and digital collections will form an integral part of the course. Through field trips and guest speakers, students will be prompted to engage themes and methods discussed in the class within their immediate local context of Rochester.  </data>

It spans roughly 40 centuries from ancient Mesopotamia to post-world war South America to investigate how cities have been made by, and have made, humans. This course will focus on one or two cities based on a theme each week and discuss the urban built environment and monumental architecture in their historical context. In this course, students will learn about the history of major cities such as Rome, Cairo, Tenochtitlan, Angkor, Paris, Beijing, Isfahan, New York, and Brasília. More importantly, they will comprehend critical social, economic, and political themes from the “Agricultural Revolution” to Capitalism. Finally, they practice how to “read” urban spaces by developing their spatial analytical skills in historical contexts.</data>

      <data key="d0">This course looks at how artists as well as museums themselves have been "critiquing" themuseum for generations, and at how museums are reinventing themselves under present daypressures. Battles rage over who art belongs to––from indigenous peoples to the artiststhemselves––and over how to conserve and display it. And on the flip side, museums have toadapt to a world in which artworks are visible on our tiny screens. What do we make of themany distinctions—between art and non-art, between ownership and stewardship, betweenpresent and past, between performance and object—that museums are built on, and arecontinually redefining? Through readings and potentially a visit to NYC's museums andgalleries, this seminar will examine these issues.</data>

      <data key="d0">When we look at works of art in museums, galleries, and churches we are, in most cases, looking at them out of context. Furthermore, when we look at early Renaissance paintings we do not see them through the eyes of the people who produced them or for whom they were produced. We have to learn to see them as they might have been seen. We can begin to do this by learning how to read and to interpret the complex elements at play beneath the immediate surface by setting the artist, his work, and his public in their social and religious historical contexts, and by exploring the universal unspoken language of signs and symbols used by artists. The course content is based on painted forms, i.e., panels, canvases, and frescos from the Trecento and Quattrocento with an emphasis on Tuscan painting. The selection, as far as possible, takes advantage of the availability of works in churches, museums, and galleries within easy visiting distance of Arezzo.</data>

At the end of the semester, students will have an overall picture of Islamic dynastic history, its broad geographical expansion from Spain to India, and its cultural themes such as political system, social structure, economic sectors, religious rituals, cross-cultural exchanges, diplomatic gifting, royal leisure, and funerary practices. This course invites students to see artifacts as not merely passive objects but active agents in history as well as their everyday lives. It also discusses a few technical aspects of weaving textiles and looks at textiles as three-dimensional objects. Finally, this course will assist students with developing their critical thinking, research, and writing as crucial skills to succeed in their future careers through weekly readings, visual analysis, in-class discussions, and research projects.</data>

Travel brochures, guidebooks, photographs, postcards, films and other objects reflect changing concepts of urban space, rural culture, industry, geography, and military and political authority. Recurrent iconography and coded images link tourism and educational objects and images with evolving concepts of and questions regarding modernity, nationalism and cultural identity: e.g., how is the meaning of “modernity” in Japan useful to a study of the continuous transformation of culture in specific contexts, as in the transition from ukiyo-e culture to photography and animated films? This lecture/discussion course has a digital component: students work hands-on with the Re-Envisioning Japan Collection and digital archive, learning both critical analysis and digital curation skills.

We will spend time in the Memorial Art Gallery with works by Dürer, Raimondi, Schedel, Bruegel, Altdorfer, Ortelius, Cock, van Leyden, Ghisi, Callot, Breydenbach, and Rembrandt, as well as with treatises and essays on the early collecting of prints.

By contrast, when the English crashed into their own unseen continent a century later, they landed in the arctic, and found, to some extent, nothing. Icy, unpopulated, commodity- poor, visually and temporally “abstract,” the Far North - a different kind of terra incognita for the early modern imagination than the sun-drenched Indies, offered no clear stuff to be seen or exploited.

Neither a continent, nor an ocean, nor a meteorological circumstance, the Arctic forced explorers, writers, and early artists from England, the Netherlands, and Germany to grapple with a different kind of “ecology.” Here, there were virtually no exotic animals, teeming forests, or enchanting civilizations to study, exploit, or exterminate - yet. In the frigid North, that is, the idea of description as a kind of accumulative endeavor of “representation” - of exoticism as synonymous with abundance - was thrown into question; the North was unsettling not because of dazzling difference, but because of monotonous sameness. Rather than an Eden, to Renaissance travelers the arctic was something like the moon.</data>

In addition, we will interrogate the Eurocentric ideas of modernity through its political, epistemological, ethical, technological, and gendered dimensions while also examining the emergence of Islamic modernities, i.e., ways of being Muslim and modern that grew out of encounters on the African continent. In the process, we will engage with issues of colonialism and the formation of nation-states and how those processes gave rise to contemporary geopolitical concerns on the continent.

Through assigned reading, students will learn about the history, sociology, and cultural logics of Rochester and the wider region, and of mass incarceration. What does a prison mean for a person living near one? How does the presence of prisons shape people's notions of justice, citizenship, and punishment? How do these nearby but largely invisible institutions shape the ways that we live in Rochester? Recommended prior courses: Introduction to Cultural Anthropology or Incarceration Nation</data>

      <data key="d0">This course adopts an anthropological approach towards understanding the dramatic socio-cultural transformations that have followed in the wake of China’s post-Mao economic reforms. What happens when a society officially committed to economic and gender equality witnesses the rise of stark social divisions? Beginning with an historical overview of the key features of the Maoist and post-Mao periods, we will move on to examine such issues as the creation of a market economy, the rise of new social classes, rural to urban migration, changing ideologies of gender and sexuality, new attitudes towards education and work, transformations in family life, religious revival and conversion, and the influences of global popular culture and mass consumption, with an eye towards identifying both continuities and departures from the Maoist era. Throughout our discussions we will consider the implications of these changes for China’s political, social, and economic futures.</data>

It builds on the first course, Introduction to Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR). The goal of the course is to provide exposure to problems in the AR/VR domain addressed by various disciplines. The course consists of three one-month long modules in a semester. Modules engage students in particular aspects of AR/VR or hands-on experience on AR/VR. Modules to be offered in various years include: fundamentals of optics for AR/VR; AR/VR in the silicon; foundations of visual perception in the context of AR/VR; computer audition and acoustic rendering; measuring the human brain; deep learning and visual recognition for AR/VR; brain-computer interfacing in a virtual environment; 3D interfaces and interaction; AR/VR for collaborative education &amp; professional training. In Spring 2023, the following three modules will be offered: 1) Deep learning and visual recognition for AR/VR. (Prof. Chenliang Xu) Recent developments in deep learning have significantly advanced state-of-the-art visual recognition in problems such as object detection, activity recognition, and semantic segmentation. In this module, students will learn core concepts in deep learning, including convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks. They will receive hands-on experience using popular deep-learning libraries like PyTorch to build visual recognition algorithms for AR/VR systems. 2) Measuring the human brain. (Prof. Ross Maddox) This module will introduce students to studies of human brain function using non-invasive methods. It will focus on experimental paradigms and data analysis in the time and frequency domains. Neural encoding and decoding models and applications to brain-computer interfaces will also be discussed. The module will have a mixed format, with lectures and labs. Lab exercises will be based on analyzing real data from human subjects. 3) Professional encounters with leading AR/VR researchers. This module will involve a series of seminars and discussion sessions with leading AR/VR researchers from academia and industry.

You will design your own experiments, construct new genetic parts, and validate the constructs using new characterization assays. In addition to the wet-lab research, iGEM involves mathematical modeling to predict the behavior and guide the design of the new biological parts and characterization assays. Students also design, construct, characterize, and improve their own piece of hardware that will work together with the designed biological organism. The policy and practice component addresses the social, legal, and ethical issues of the project. iGEM is multi-disciplinary, highly collaborative, and student-managed.

This course will develop constitutive relations and strategies for solving boundary value problems in linear viscoelastic materials. In addition, the closely-related biphasic theory for fluid-filled porous solids will be introduced. An emphasis will be placed on applications to cartilage, tendon, ligament, muscle, blood vessels, and other biological tissues. Advanced topics including non-linear viscoelasticity, composite viscoelasticity and physical mechanisms of viscoelasticity will be surveyed. Preerequisites: ME225 or CHE243; ME226 or BME201</data>

      <data key="d0">This is the second course offered as part of the PhD training program on augmented and virtual reality. It builds on the first course, Introduction to Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR). The goal of the course is to provide exposure to problems in the AR/VR domain addressed by various disciplines. The course consists of three one-month long modules in a semester. Modules engage students in particular aspects of AR/VR or hands-on experience on AR/VR. Modules to be offered in various years include: fundamentals of optics for AR/VR; AR/VR in the silicon; foundations of visual perception in the context of AR/VR; computer audition and acoustic rendering; measuring the human brain; deep learning and visual recognition for AR/VR; brain-computer interfacing in a virtual environment; 3D interfaces and interaction; AR/VR for collaborative education &amp; professional training. In Spring 2023, the following three modules will be offered: 1) Deep learning and visual recognition for AR/VR. (Prof. Chenliang Xu) Recent developments in deep learning have significantly advanced state-of-the-art visual recognition in problems such as object detection, activity recognition, and semantic segmentation. In this module, students will learn core concepts in deep learning, including convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks. They will receive hands-on experience using popular deep-learning libraries like PyTorch to build visual recognition algorithms for AR/VR systems. 2) Measuring the human brain. (Prof. Ross Maddox) This module will introduce students to studies of human brain function using non-invasive methods. It will focus on experimental paradigms and data analysis in the time and frequency domains. Neural encoding and decoding models and applications to brain-computer interfaces will also be discussed. The module will have a mixed format, with lectures and labs. Lab exercises will be based on analyzing real data from human subjects. 3) Professional encounters with leading AR/VR researchers. This module will involve a series of seminars and discussion sessions with leading AR/VR researchers from academia and industry.

The fault lines of race, faith, and politics are exacerbated by a lack of understanding of how these identities become barriers to genuine conversation. Divisive sub-groups serve as echo chambers, cutting us off from talking across the divides.  “The Bridging the Gap program is designed to combat the toxic polarization in our country, give students the skills they need to find common ground across deep divides, solve problems in their communities, thrive in the workplace of the future, and support students in their own character formation journey” (Interfaith America, 2022). Through these direct engagements and experiences, this community engaged course will teach students how to truly listen, understand, be heard, and seek common ground without attempting to change minds or having to compromise deeply held values. This course will give students the tools to find areas of common ground, live in constructive tension, understand our shared humanity and solve pressing problems with those of different backgrounds and beliefs. This course is designed to bring together students from culturally, theologically, politically, and racially diverse backgrounds to create a brave space for courageous conversations and to understand and explore solutions to one of America’s most pressing social problems: The call to defund the police: redefining “public safety” and what police reform might look like as America continues to wrestle with structural racism. This course will offer classroom learning on dialogue skills across political, cultural, and experiential differences, with intensive skill building sessions to practice these dialogue skills during a mandatory weekend retreat from January 13-15, and site visits with a broad range of police and public safety and stakeholders from our campus, the City of Rochester, and the State of New York.  </data>

      <data key="d0">(4 credits, Fall, Spring) Chemistry 252 covers thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and chemical kinetics. These subjects provide a fundamental understanding of the behavior of matter and energy. The focus of the class is on both Thermodynamics, which is the mathematical theory of heat, gives rules describing how heat flows, and the relationship between heat and other kinds of energy, as well as on Statistical mechanics, which is the discipline that explains the nature of temperature, entropy, and provides a fundamental and microscopic explanation of thermodynamics in terms of probability and laws of statistics. The course follows the textbook “Molecular Thermodynamics” by D.A. McQuarrie and John Simon, and “Molecular Driving Force” by K.A. Dill and S. Bromberg.The course begins with the concept of Microstates and Entropy, the equal a priori probabilities assumption, the direction of approaching equilibrium as a process that maximizes the total number of microstates. It then discusses the nature of Temperature and uses heat transfer as an example to illustrate the process that maximizes the number of microstates. It continues with the derivation of the Boltzmann distribution and the physical meaning of partition function, followed by simple and concise applications of Boltzmann distribution. It then covers the factorization approximation, Translational Partition Function and Partition function of the monatomic ideal gas, obtaining energy and pressure from the partition function. It follows with the vibrational and rotational partition functions, and the intuitive understanding of heat capacities of solid and diatomic molecules. The course continues with the equipartition theorem of energy, and the concept of negative temperature. It then covers the Statistical Entropy, Entropy for model systems and detailed examples, Gibbs Entropy Formula and applications. For the Thermodynamics part of the class, it begins with the Basic logic of Thermodynamics, spontaneous processes, and the direction of approaching equilibrium. It continuous with the first law of Thermodynamics, Work, and Heat, The second law of Thermodynamics, and thermodynamics definition of Entropy, The third law of Thermodynamics, the Temperature dependence of Entropy, the concept of Enthalpy and its application in Thermochemistry. Then it follows with the Helmholtz Free energy, Gibbs Free Energy, Maxwell Relation and Gibbs-Helmholtz equation. The course then discusses the applications, focusing on Phase Equilibria, Chemical Potential, Gibbs-Duhem Equation, Solutions. It ends with the discussions of Chemical Equilibrium, Chemical Kinetics, Transition State Theory. The course also has peer-lead workshop sessions. In these sessions, students will work in teams and lead by workshop leaders to discuss concepts learned in lectures and solve problems that exemplify the concepts discussed in lecture material and explain their solutions to each other. Workshops help the students to engage with the material together with their peers. The class also contains 2-3 midterm exams and 10-11 homework problems, as well as a final exam.This course uses the Tues/Thurs 8:00 - 9:30 am Common Exam time.

      <data key="d0">(4 credits, Fall, Spring) Chemistry 252 covers thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and chemical kinetics. These subjects provide a fundamental understanding of the behavior of matter and energy. The focus of the class is on both Thermodynamics, which is the mathematical theory of heat, gives rules describing how heat flows, and the relationship between heat and other kinds of energy, as well as on Statistical mechanics, which is the discipline that explains the nature of temperature, entropy, and provides a fundamental and microscopic explanation of thermodynamics in terms of probability and laws of statistics. The course follows the textbook “Molecular Thermodynamics” by D.A. McQuarrie and John Simon, and “Molecular Driving Force” by K.A. Dill and S. Bromberg.The course begins with the concept of Microstates and Entropy, the equal a priori probabilities assumption, the direction of approaching equilibrium as a process that maximizes the total number of microstates. It then discusses the nature of Temperature and uses heat transfer as an example to illustrate the process that maximizes the number of microstates. It continues with the derivation of the Boltzmann distribution and the physical meaning of partition function, followed by simple and concise applications of Boltzmann distribution. It then covers the factorization approximation, Translational Partition Function and Partition function of the monatomic ideal gas, obtaining energy and pressure from the partition function. It follows with the vibrational and rotational partition functions, and the intuitive understanding of heat capacities of solid and diatomic molecules. The course continues with the equipartition theorem of energy, and the concept of negative temperature. It then covers the Statistical Entropy, Entropy for model systems and detailed examples, Gibbs Entropy Formula and applications. For the Thermodynamics part of the class, it begins with the Basic logic of Thermodynamics, spontaneous processes, and the direction of approaching equilibrium. It continuous with the first law of Thermodynamics, Work, and Heat, The second law of Thermodynamics, and thermodynamics definition of Entropy, The third law of Thermodynamics, the Temperature dependence of Entropy, the concept of Enthalpy and its application in Thermochemistry. Then it follows with the Helmholtz Free energy, Gibbs Free Energy, Maxwell Relation and Gibbs-Helmholtz equation. The course then discusses the applications, focusing on Phase Equilibria, Chemical Potential, Gibbs-Duhem Equation, Solutions. It ends with the discussions of Chemical Equilibrium, Chemical Kinetics, Transition State Theory. The course also has peer-lead workshop sessions. In these sessions, students will work in teams and lead by workshop leaders to discuss concepts learned in lectures and solve problems that exemplify the concepts discussed in lecture material and explain their solutions to each other. Workshops help the students to engage with the material together with their peers. The class also contains 2-3 midterm exams and 10-11 homework problems, as well as a final exam.This course uses the Tues/Thurs 8:00 - 9:30 am Common Exam time.

Against the “hegemonic corporate forces of predatory capitalism,” aid agencies perform the work of welfare workers who are part of the network of moral discourses, religious beliefs, ethical commitments, and international norms that generate an obligation to help distant strangers.” Humanitarianism and Social Insecurities engages students in a critical understanding of humanitarianism discourses and practices through an investigation of polemics, misunderstandings, testimonials, and the creative imagination inspired by humanitarian interventions. With the recognition that “noble actions can have negative and unintended consequences”, this course takes the student from a position of moral indignation to one of a critical indignation, and ultimately, a better understanding of the practices and discourses generated by the phenomenon of charity, humanitarianism, and Social Insecurities.</data>

      <data key="d0">Revolutions and Revolt is an experimental course that examines 20th century German cultural history. We will explore questions of social justice, representation, and political expression clustered around three major revolutionary moments: the German Revolution of 1918, the German Student Movement of 1968, and the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Our course will be oriented by a careful reading of Marx and Engle's Communist Manifesto, that, while also defining the conditions of possibility for an empowered proletarian class, can also be used a tool to reflect on the revolutionary features of language, poetry, and art. We will think about specific genres – the manifesto, the pamphlet, political theater, and film, as genres that calls or could call "revolution" into being. These historical hinge points (a term I am borrowing from Matt Christman) bring various emancipatory impulses into relief, beyond the history of class conflict described in the Communist Manifesto, and we will engage with pacificist, anti-fascist, feminist, and Jewish texts and artworks. This course is conducted in English, and our readings are English translations of German texts, but if students of German would like to work on original texts, these can be provided along with alternative assignments where German language practice might be implemented.</data>

This course considers the 'traffic jams' the far-flung possible worlds imagined in Japanese science fiction from the 1920s to the present. Genres covered include the short story, short short story, novel, manga, anime, and film. Japanese science fiction is considered in planetary perspective: Japanese works are considered alongside pertinent works from other national traditions of science fiction. This course is interested ultimately in explorations of a futuristic approach to the study of literature: it is interested in what our readings today might tell us about what tomorrow might bring.

      <data key="d0">When modern Russian literature began to evolve in the mid-1600s, the printed or written text was immediately seen as a potential danger to the power of Church and State. In this course we will examine dangerous texts' from the 17th century to the present to see what aspects of texts and their authors were seen as threats and how these threats were dealt with. We will also see the ways in which writers did indeed perceive themselves as a second government' and how this changed the way they wrote. The reading list will include works by: Avvakum, Radishchev, Pushkin, Lermontov, Gogol, Turgenev, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Babel, Mayakovsky, Mandelstam, Pasternak, Yevtushenko, Solzhenitsyn, Voinovich, Grossman, and Sinyavsky/Tertz.

Students read literature and theory with an eye toward understanding the role of criticism and why and how the study of literature and culture (still) matters. The class introduces tools for understanding literary uses of languages; the relations between words, images, the human subject and society; and the creation of and struggles over meaning and value. This seminar will model for students how to do research in their MLC major through a workshop process that addresses ways to: identify a research topic/question; begin a scholarly investigation into that topic; and successfully conduct a sustained argument that relies on textual evidence and the application of theoretical insights. There will be short writing assignments and a 15-20-page research paper. Non-majors should request permission before registering. Prerequisite: CLTR 200.</data>

Travel brochures, guidebooks, photographs, postcards, films and other objects reflect changing concepts of urban space, rural culture, industry, geography, and military and political authority. Recurrent iconography and coded images link tourism and educational objects and images with evolving concepts of and questions regarding modernity, nationalism and cultural identity: e.g., how is the meaning of “modernity” in Japan useful to a study of the continuous transformation of culture in specific contexts, as in the transition from ukiyo-e culture to photography and animated films? This lecture/discussion course has a digital component: students work hands-on with the Re-Envisioning Japan Collection and digital archive, learning both critical analysis and digital curation skills.

      <data key="d0">Humanitarianism, largely understood as the ultimate of ethical acts, took root in the modern world not as a response to war or “emergencies” but as part of an effort to remake the world so that it better served the interests of humanity. Against the “hegemonic corporate forces of predatory capitalism,” aid agencies perform the work of welfare workers who are part of the network of moral discourses, religious beliefs, ethical commitments, and international norms that generate an obligation to help distant strangers.” Humanitarianism and Social Insecurities engages students in a critical understanding of humanitarianism discourses and practices through an investigation of polemics, misunderstandings, testimonials, and the creative imagination inspired by humanitarian interventions. With the recognition that “noble actions can have negative and unintended consequences”, this course takes the student from a position of moral indignation to one of a critical indignation, and ultimately, a better understanding of the practices and discourses generated by the phenomenon of charity, humanitarianism, and Social Insecurities.</data>

This course considers the tangible object that is the source of the image onscreen, and the social, cultural, and historical value of a reel of film as an organic element with a finite life cycle. We focus on the analog photographic element and its origins (both theatrical and small gauge), the basics of photochemical film technology, and the state of film conservation and preservation worldwide. Guest lectures by staff of the Moving Image Department of George Eastman Museum provide a first-hand look at film preservation in action, allowing us to consider analog film as an ephemeral form of material culture: a multipurpose, visual record that is art, entertainment, evidentiary document, and historical artifact. Weekly film assignments. Class meets on River Campus and at George Eastman Museum (900 East Ave, no admission fee but students provide their own transportation). No audits, no pre-requisites.

      <data key="d0">Revolutions and Revolt is an experimental course that examines 20th century German cultural history. We will explore questions of social justice, representation, and political expression clustered around three major revolutionary moments: the German Revolution of 1918, the German Student Movement of 1968, and the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Our course will be oriented by a careful reading of Marx and Engle's Communist Manifesto, that, while also defining the conditions of possibility for an empowered proletarian class, can also be used a tool to reflect on the revolutionary features of language, poetry, and art. We will think about specific genres – the manifesto, the pamphlet, political theater, and film, as genres that calls or could call "revolution" into being. These historical hinge points (a term I am borrowing from Matt Christman) bring various emancipatory impulses into relief, beyond the history of class conflict described in the Communist Manifesto, and we will engage with pacificist, anti-fascist, feminist, and Jewish texts and artworks. This course is conducted in English, and our readings are English translations of German texts, but if students of German would like to work on original texts, these can be provided along with alternative assignments where German language practice might be implemented.</data>

This course uses video and moving image to examine the deep intertwined and intersectional roots of the ecological crisis, from viral pandemics and racial justice to the disruption of our climate and all the other apocalyptic scenarios we currently find ourselves in. To guide our development of eco-cinematic consciousness, we will study the works of Kenyan activist Mangari Maathai, Native American (Chickasaw) writer Linda Hogan, and French philosopher Félix Guattari's foundational text, The Three Ecologies, to understand how ecologies of mind, media, and environment are interrelated and to complicate our understandings of "nature." Student Projects will involve installation, single-channel, sound, and networked-based approaches. Works will be examined within a critical environmental arts framework through readings, critiques, viewings and discussions. Permission of instructor. $75 studio fee. </data>

In this course, students are invited to dig deeply into a question of interest, write for a public audience, and use the Internet as an archive of information waiting to be discovered, analyzed, and written about. Students can draw on pre-existing research interests from their majors or develop a line of inquiry stemming from class discussions, writing, and research. In order to gain experience writing to a range of readers, students will engage in a writing process informed by peer review, self-assessment, and revision. Shorter writing assignments will help students develop and refine ideas as they transform texts for different audiences. The final research project will be multimodal, published for a public audience, and should demonstrate your ability to think critically about a topic and effectively communicate that knowledge to a range of readers.Prerequisite: Completion of the Primary Writing Requirement.</data>

      <data key="d0">This course teaches how to approach and solve a wide range of organizational design problems, whether as manager at any level, entrepreneur, or consultant. In a world in which most sources of competitive advantage are fleeting, organizational effectiveness has emerged as a key source of long-run competitive advantage. Conversely, many corporate failures can be traced to poor internal organization. Problems covered range from individual job design to the structure of entire organizations and the boundaries of the firm (e.g., M&amp;A decisions or vertical integration). The course discusses in detail the assignment of decision rights (including centralization vs. decentralization of decisions), performance measurement, and incentives and rewards. These are the three elements of “organizational architecture,” a central framework of the course. Throughout, the course stresses the importance of fit between a firm’s internal organization and its strategy.

      <data key="d0">When Spanish and Portuguese explorers stumbled upon a sunny "America" that was new to them, they encountered balmy wonders – armadillos, cities, and gold. By contrast, when the English crashed into their own unseen continent a century later, they landed in the arctic, and found, to some extent, nothing. Icy, unpopulated, commodity- poor, visually and temporally “abstract,” the Far North - a different kind of terra incognita for the early modern imagination than the sun-drenched Indies, offered no clear stuff to be seen or exploited. With this, this seminar contends, the Arctic quietly yet powerfully challenged older narratives of world- and picture-making. Neither a continent, nor an ocean, nor a meteorological circumstance, the Arctic forced explorers, writers, and early artists from England, the Netherlands, and Germany to grapple with a different kind of “ecology.” Here, there were virtually no exotic animals, teeming forests, or enchanting civilizations to study, exploit, or exterminate - yet. In the frigid North, that is, the idea of description as a kind of accumulative endeavor of “representation” - of exoticism as synonymous with abundance - was thrown into question; the North was unsettling not because of dazzling difference, but because of monotonous sameness. Rather than an Eden, to Renaissance travelers the arctic was something like the moon.</data>

      <data key="d0">We will take a very bold and ambitious approach to the study of literature, surveying a group of landmark literary works starting in Greek, Hebrew, and Latin antiquity, and concluding in the early twentieth century. We often associate that kind of study with the notion of “great books.” I won’t dispute that will read some of those this semester. But what really unites these works is that they understood themselves to be contributing to a cultural tradition in which each work builds on prior ones to achieve something new. The important point is not that these books count as Western masterpieces, but that they played a role in the invention and diffusion of that very idea. We will try to approach this set of literary works as their authors and first readers did: not as a disconnected series of individual creations but as a cultural whole greater than the sum of its parts—a living literary history which helped to produce the idea of a “western” culture or of the more particular national cultures that made it up.</data>

How do copy editors understand and negotiate the relationships and interests of readers, writers, and the publications they work for? How has the information age changed the way copy editors think about and approach textual editing? In this class we will address both the principles and practices of copyediting.

      <data key="d0">This course focuses on drama written by Shakespeare's contemporaries.  Classes center around careful analysis of individual plays.  We discuss, among other topics, the plays' tragic and comic inflections, depictions of psychological interiority, meditations on love and desire, staging of death, use of props, fascination with sensational and often violent events, and insistent references to contemporary performance practices.  We also become familiar with a range of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century theatrical spaces—their geographical locations and physical properties, the composition of their audiences, the training and performance practices of their actors, and the aesthetic, social, and political contexts of their productions. We consider plays written by Beaumont and Fletcher, Dekker, Ford, Jonson, Kyd, Marlowe, Middleton, and Webster and, when possible, view scenes from recent staged productions. Satisfies the pre-1800 literature, the dramatic literature, the literature, and the 200-level literature requirements for various English major and minor tracks. Satisfies a requirement in the Humanities/English cluster, Plays, Playwrights, and Theater.  Appropriate for all students, from those in their first semester at the university to senior English majors.

      <data key="d0">This course will examine the literary career of one of the most accomplished, intriguing, and influential poets of the English language, John Milton. Milton thrived during a time when many of the most urgent conversations we are still having about democracy, empire, gender, race, individuality, religion, technology, work, and nature were first formulated. Keeping this context in mind, students will read Milton’s major lyric, epic, and dramatic poetry, focusing especially on Paradise Lost, his epic retelling of the primal rebellion of Satan against God, as well as a selection of his prose writings, including his influential attacks on state censorship and his still-radical defenses of revolutionary action. We will also examine Milton’s legacy, especially his profound importance for later writers like Phillis Wheatley, William Blake, and Mary Shelley. This course fulfills the Pre-1800 requirement for English majors.</data>

Three capacious topics will organize discussions: nature and art, society and history, and individuals and communities. As part of each of these topics, we will also consider the pressures and controversies around slavery, race, and gender that were dividing the States in the decades before the Civil War.  We will read works by Cooper, Childs, Emerson, Thoreau, Fuller, Melville, Poe, Douglass, Jacobs, Hawthorne, Stowe, Whitman, Lincoln, Dickinson, and others. Of particular interest throughout the term will be the hopes and anxieties, allegiances and resistances, aesthetic triumphs and political frustrations that characters American romantic artists and have made the imagination a crucial part of the nation's life and an indispensable resource for its people even at moments when fundamental conflicts threatened to end the nation altogether.</data>

      <data key="d0">“Make it New” has generally been accepted as modernism’s battle cry, and 1922 has often been seen as the year modernism changed the world with the publication of key modernist masterpieces. But a century on, the novelty of its classics invites reinvestigation. We will explore how contemporary writers and filmmakers have recast and transformed iconic texts by writers like Conrad, Forster, Joyce, and Woolf for new times and new audiences, sometimes literally taking them apart and re-piecing them together. What happens when a novel is transposed to a new medium, genre, or point of view? What do the texts look like in transnational and multicultural settings? What happens when Conrad’s Heart of Darkness is refigured as a Vietnam era film or a graphic novel? What if Mrs. Dalloway is reduced to a five minute YouTube video? Looking at multiple versions of a few key texts, we will apply theories of adaptation and media studies, including ideas of remediation and remixing. We will also look at how digital technologies have produced new modernist artifacts, allowing us to explore multiple versions of a single text. </data>

      <data key="d0">We will be looking at many different sorts of poem in this class: love poems, nature poems, mourning poems, memory poems, dream poems, poems about childhood, poems of madness and crisis, nonsense poems, hymns, riddles, and ballads. Lyric poetry speaks out of passion and playfulness, out of wonder and doubt. It asks us to credit forgotten or neglected parts of our experience, our intuitive selves. A poem is a “small (or large) machine made out of words,” the poet William Carlos William wrote. Such machines always play strange games with language, opening up and transforming our ordinary speech, teaching us to listen to it better, finding words starker or more beautiful, or more ambiguous, than we usually recognize.  Poetry also channels the energy of silence, the claims of what’s unsaid, or speaks for things that cannot speak.  Readings will include a great range older and more contemporary poets. During the last 3 weeks we’ll concentrate on the work of a single poet, probably Emily Dickinson or Elizabeth Bishop. Fulfills the post-1800 requirement for English majors. Not open to Freshmen without instructor permission.</data>

Clarke's novels Rendezvous with Rama and Childhood's End will be read in conjunction with Le Guin's The Left Hand of Darkness and The Dispossessed. We will read Solaris by Lem and see one or both films made of it. Faber’s Under the Skin interrogates our treatment of animals by making us prey to aliens and The Book of Strange New Things tells the daring story about a minister who has been asked by a non-human race to continue his missionary work on Oasis, with no concept that his idea of Christianity doesn’t square with theirs. We end with Ted Chiang’s story and its film adaptation, Arrival, which investigates cultural barriers created by language, body, and foreign ground—matters that drive all stories about the Otherworld, and the complex problems of misreading each other.</data>

The global reach of both its authors and audiences has made contemporary women’s writing a truly international phenomenon. We will examine what makes this work especially innovative: its experimentation with new voices and narrative forms and its blurring of genre boundaries. We will look at the dialogue it has established with the past, where it often finds its inspiration, self-consciously appropriating earlier literary texts or rewriting history.  We will also consider what special challenges this work poses for its readers.

This course considers the tangible object that is the source of the image onscreen, and the social, cultural, and historical value of a reel of film as an organic element with a finite life cycle. We focus on the analog photographic element and its origins (both theatrical and small gauge), the basics of photochemical film technology, and the state of film conservation and preservation worldwide. Guest lectures by staff of the Moving Image Department of George Eastman Museum provide a first-hand look at film preservation in action, allowing us to consider analog film as an ephemeral form of material culture: a multipurpose, visual record that is art, entertainment, evidentiary document, and historical artifact. Weekly film assignments. Class meets on River Campus and at George Eastman Museum (900 East Ave, no admission fee but students provide their own transportation). No audits, no pre-requisites.

This course will explore the creative development of this concept from Greek and Hebrew thought in medieval and early modern traditions where language served to hide, protect, conjure, and transform: the letters of the Paternoster that defeat the devil, Odin’s Mead of Poetry, Taliesin’s aretalogies, Germanic runes, riddles, charms, loricae, spells, ciphers (the indecipherable Voynich Manuscript, the banned Steganography by Trithemius of Sponheim), magic and foreign alphabets, deific languages (the Irish “Evernew Tongue”), glossolalia, demonic languages, invented languages (Hildegard of Bingen’s Lingua Ignota), John Dee’s “language of the angels,” Enochian,” adopted by Aleister Crowley for his “Order of the Golden Dawn.” I want to discover what properties in language do more than just signify.

      <data key="d0">This course focuses on drama written by Shakespeare's contemporaries.  Classes center around careful analysis of individual plays.  We discuss, among other topics, the plays' tragic and comic inflections, depictions of psychological interiority, meditations on love and desire, staging of death, use of props, fascination with sensational and often violent events, and insistent references to contemporary performance practices.  We also become familiar with a range of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century theatrical spaces—their geographical locations and physical properties, the composition of their audiences, the training and performance practices of their actors, and the aesthetic, social, and political contexts of their productions. We consider plays written by Beaumont and Fletcher, Dekker, Ford, Jonson, Kyd, Marlowe, Middleton, and Webster and, when possible, view scenes from recent staged productions. Satisfies the pre-1800 literature, the dramatic literature, the literature, and the 200-level literature requirements for various English major and minor tracks. Satisfies a requirement in the Humanities/English cluster, Plays, Playwrights, and Theater.  Appropriate for all students, from those in their first semester at the university to senior English majors.

      <data key="d0">This course will examine the literary career of one of the most accomplished, intriguing, and influential poets of the English language, John Milton. Milton thrived during a time when many of the most urgent conversations we are still having about democracy, empire, gender, race, individuality, religion, technology, work, and nature were first formulated. Keeping this context in mind, students will read Milton’s major lyric, epic, and dramatic poetry, focusing especially on Paradise Lost, his epic retelling of the primal rebellion of Satan against God, as well as a selection of his prose writings, including his influential attacks on state censorship and his still-radical defenses of revolutionary action. We will also examine Milton’s legacy, especially his profound importance for later writers like Phillis Wheatley, William Blake, and Mary Shelley. This course fulfills the Pre-1800 requirement for English majors.</data>

Three capacious topics will organize discussions: nature and art, society and history, and individuals and communities. As part of each of these topics, we will also consider the pressures and controversies around slavery, race, and gender that were dividing the States in the decades before the Civil War. We will read works by Cooper, Childs, Emerson, Thoreau, Fuller, Melville, Poe, Douglass, Jacobs, Hawthorne, Stowe, Whitman, Lincoln, Dickinson, and others. Of particular interest throughout the term will be the hopes and anxieties, allegiances and resistances, aesthetic triumphs and political frustrations that characters American romantic artists and have made the imagination a crucial part of the nation's life and an indispensable resource for its people even at moments when fundamental conflicts threatened to end the nation altogether.</data>

      <data key="d0">“Make it New” has generally been accepted as modernism’s battle cry, and 1922 has often been seen as the year modernism changed the world with the publication of key modernist masterpieces. But a century on, the novelty of its classics invites reinvestigation. We will explore how contemporary writers and filmmakers have recast and transformed iconic texts by writers like Conrad, Forster, Joyce, and Woolf for new times and new audiences, sometimes literally taking them apart and re-piecing them together. What happens when a novel is transposed to a new medium, genre, or point of view? What do the texts look like in transnational and multicultural settings? What happens when Conrad’s Heart of Darkness is refigured as a Vietnam era film or a graphic novel? What if Mrs. Dalloway is reduced to a five minute YouTube video? Looking at multiple versions of a few key texts, we will apply theories of adaptation and media studies, including ideas of remediation and remixing. We will also look at how digital technologies have produced new modernist artifacts, allowing us to explore multiple versions of a single text. </data>

      <data key="d0">Encountering early texts in their manuscript and print contexts, as the original readers would have, is a dramatically different experience from reading medieval and early modern literature today. Although differences in letter forms, bindings, ink, illumination practices, spelling, rubrication, punctuation, glossing, and page layout all contribute to this, perhaps the most significant difference is the way in which multiple texts were compiled and grouped into codices by medieval scribes and early modern printers. The miscellany, in fact, is the norm among vernacular books in England for most of its literary history. A medieval reader would have encountered Beowulf alongside a poetic translation of the Hebrew Bible’s Judith and the prose Letter of Alexander to Aristotle; readers of the codex in which Sir Gawain and the Green Knight is found might instead have been more interested in Pearl or Cleanness; Wyatt first appeared to most Renaissance English readers fifteen years after his death in Tottel’s Miscellany. Yet today, Beowulf is nearly a household name, while its neighbors (copied by the same two scribes in London, British Library, MS Vitellius A.XV) are nearly forgotten. This research seminar will explore practices of compilation in several early books and recent scholarship examining important miscellanies; we will also read two late-medieval works (by the English poet Thomas Hoccleve and the German mystic Henry Suso) which dramatize the process of creating a collection of disparate texts. The term will conclude with student reports on individual miscellanies of particular interest to their own research, as well as some “pseudo-miscellanies” (such as the eighteenth-century Bog-House Miscellany, purporting to assemble poetry from the walls of public toilets across Britain).</data>

      <data key="d0">The modern histories of both racism and abolitionism can be traced to the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries, a period that witnessed genocidal trade wars in South Asia, the enslavement of millions of Africans in the trans-Atlantic slave trade, and the deracination of many of the First Nations of the Americas. Writers at the time—those who glorified these and other atrocities, those who condemned them, and those who simply stood by as they happened—almost always interpreted these events within the conceptual vocabulary we now associate with religion: the language of soul, spirit, prophecy, witchcraft, apocalypse, redemption, salvation, damnation, angelic inspiration, and demonic possession. This course seeks to interrogate this connection. To what extent does an awareness of this spiritual dimension of the economic, social, and psychological histories of race illuminate past texts? Present circumstances? Future possibilities? While the course focuses on early modern Anglophone writers (including William Shakespeare, Mary Rowlandson, Phillis Wheatley, Olaudah Equiano, and Ottobah Cugoano) it also emphasizes urgent scholarly and literary-critical writings of recent years which have sought both to interpret the world and to change it.</data>

      <data key="d0">Toril Moi, in her book, Revolution of the Ordinary (2017) has urged ordinary language as a framework for the study of literature. This sense of language highlights speakers and uses in all contexts. Moi and Rita Felskialso consider how this view of language overrides the traditional “hermeneutics of suspicion”--a way of reading that separates “meaning” from observable language, that meaning is occult, or that it needs to be recovered from texts and speech. Both critics urge a renewed respect for the experience and contexts of reading, for how different constituencies read and talk about literature through tropes of common sense, local interest, and collective purpose. We consider, in the light of 20th century criticism and theory, how this perspective on literary study has come about. We review New Criticism and early statements by feminist and critics of color that led to Moi’s and Felski’s proposals. Students are invited to propose texts to be read as “ordinary literature.”</data>

      <data key="d0">Is television a gendered medium? Given the prevalence of cop shows and male anti-heroes that characterize “peak” or quality TV (both past and present), many would assume that television is a “masculine” medium, made up of “masculine” genres. However, the history of television says otherwise. This course traces the numerous ways that television—as an institution, an industry, a narrative form, and a social space—becomes aligned with various notions of gender, in the form of femininity, domesticity, feminism, “women’s culture,” and the female consumer, all at different historical moments. What these different historical moments do share, however, is the assumption that the female television viewer is always coded as white, middle class, cisgender, and able-bodied. To examine how representations of gender have taken shape on television, we will study television chronologically, spanning television sitcoms and soap operas of the 1950s and 1960s, to the rise of feminist television (Julia, The Mary Tyler Moore Show) in the 1970s, to images of “working women” in the 1980s and 90s. In the final weeks of the seminar, we will discuss the rise of streaming television, “narrowcasting,” and contemporary attempts of intersectionality on television—and how new forms of television have created new ways of thinking about gender.</data>

Travel brochures, guidebooks, photographs, postcards, films and other objects reflect changing concepts of urban space, rural culture, industry, geography, and military and political authority. Recurrent iconography and coded images link tourism and educational objects and images with evolving concepts of and questions regarding modernity, nationalism and cultural identity: e.g., how is the meaning of “modernity” in Japan useful to a study of the continuous transformation of culture in specific contexts, as in the transition from ukiyo-e culture to photography and animated films? This lecture/discussion course has a digital component: students work hands-on with the Re-Envisioning Japan Collection and digital archive, learning both critical analysis and digital curation skills. The course includes weekly film assignments and one field trip each to the Memorial Art Gallery and George Eastman Museum. No audits. </data>

      <data key="d0">Revolutions and Revolt is an experimental course that examines 20th century German cultural history. We will explore questions of social justice, representation, and political expression clustered around three major revolutionary moments: the German Revolution of 1918, the German Student Movement of 1968, and the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Our course will be oriented by a careful reading of Marx and Engle's Communist Manifesto, that, while also defining the conditions of possibility for an empowered proletarian class, can also be used a tool to reflect on the revolutionary features of language, poetry, and art. We will think about specific genres – the manifesto, the pamphlet, political theater, and film, as genres that calls or could call "revolution" into being. These historical hinge points (a term I am borrowing from Matt Christman) bring various emancipatory impulses into relief, beyond the history of class conflict described in the Communist Manifesto, and we will engage with pacificist, anti-fascist, feminist, and Jewish texts and artworks.

      <data key="d0">Is television a gendered medium? Given the prevalence of cop shows and male anti-heroes that characterize “peak” or quality TV (both past and present), many would assume that television is a “masculine” medium, made up of “masculine” genres. However, the history of television says otherwise. This course traces the numerous ways that television—as an institution, an industry, a narrative form, and a social space—becomes aligned with various notions of gender, in the form of femininity, domesticity, feminism, “women’s culture,” and the female consumer, all at different historical moments. What these different historical moments do share, however, is the assumption that the female television viewer is always coded as white, middle class, cisgender, and able-bodied. To examine how representations of gender have taken shape on television, we will study television chronologically, spanning television sitcoms and soap operas of the 1950s and 1960s, to the rise of feminist television (Julia, The Mary Tyler Moore Show) in the 1970s, to images of “working women” in the 1980s and 90s. In the final weeks of the seminar, we will discuss the rise of streaming television, “narrowcasting,” and contemporary attempts of intersectionality on television—and how new forms of television have created new ways of thinking about gender.</data>

We will explore a multitude of feminist perspectives on the intersections of sex, gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, class, religion, and other categories of identity. In this course, we will interrogate these categories as socially constructed while acknowledging that these constructions have real effects in subordinating groups, marking bodies, and creating structural, intersectional inequalities.</data>

In this course, we will explore three of the era's most remarkable works:Giorgio Bassani's The Gold-Rimmed Spectacles, Beppe Fenoglio's A Private Affair and Natalia Ginzburg's Family Lexicon.What distinguishes them are the unique lenses through which they recount history, offering glimpses of how love, in particular, becomes entangled in politics and war: in Bassani's story, a town ostracizes an older resident for his relationship with a young man during the rise of Fascism; in Fenoglio's tale, a partisan's memories of his beloved veer him off course during the Resistance; and in Ginzburg's account, a woman relates her antifascist Jewish family's trials and tribulations under dictatorship. To complement the novels, there will be a theoretical component to elaborate the issues of gender, sexuality and relationality. Assignments include: historical, biographical and critical readings, short papers and a final essay. All readings will be in English.</data>

This course uses anthropological case studies of different kinds of energy sources (fossil fuels, nuclear, water, solar, wind) and different kinds of electrification (centralized grids versus micro-grids) around the world to think about the relationship between energy, environments, power, and culture with a specific focus on intersectional gender and sexuality. How do energy practices and cultural norms of racialized gender shape each other in various places around the world, and to what effects? What might empirical attention to how people talk about and use energy help us to understand about the energy transitions and climate crises of the 21st century?</data>

      <data key="d0">Revolutions and Revolt is an experimental course that examines 20th century German cultural history. We will explore questions of social justice, representation, and political expression clustered around three major revolutionary moments: the German Revolution of 1918, the German Student Movement of 1968, and the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Our course will be oriented by a careful reading of Marx and Engle's Communist Manifesto, that, while also defining the conditions of possibility for an empowered proletarian class, can also be used a tool to reflect on the revolutionary features of language, poetry, and art. We will think about specific genres – the manifesto, the pamphlet, political theater, and film, as genres that calls or could call "revolution" into being. These historical hinge points (a term I am borrowing from Matt Christman) bring various emancipatory impulses into relief, beyond the history of class conflict described in the Communist Manifesto, and we will engage with pacificist, anti-fascist, feminist, and Jewish texts and artworks. This course is conducted in English, and our readings are English translations of German texts, but if students of German would like to work on original texts, these can be provided along with alternative assignments where German language practice might be implemented. </data>

The global reach of both its authors and audiences has made contemporary women’s writing a truly international phenomenon. We will examine what makes this work especially innovative: its experimentation with new voices and narrative forms and its blurring of genre boundaries. We will look at the dialogue it has established with the past, where it often finds its inspiration, self-consciously appropriating earlier literary texts or rewriting history. We will also consider what special challenges this work poses for its readers. Looking at works originating in a wide range of locations, this course, will explore the diverse shapes of contemporary women's imagination and attempt to account for the compelling interest of this new body of fiction.</data>

One of the oldest languages in the world, for several centuries Hebrew was used only as a literary tool until it was revived as a national Jewish language starting in the late 19th century. Today, Hebrew is the official language of Israel and is studied and spoken by Jews and non-Jews all around the world. Used in everyday life, songs, films, and on the Internet, Hebrew has never been so young!This course is the direct continuation of HBRW 101 that is taught in the Fall. Emphasis is on further developing reading, writing, comprehension, and speaking skills, with a focus on cultural orientation and the practical use of Hebrew in meaningful everyday situations. During the semester, students will expand the basic language skills acquired in HBRW 101, enhance their understanding of Hebrew grammar constructions (in particular, verbs in the present and past tense, use of direct object and prepositional verbs, common syntactical constructions), and increase their vocabulary. The course will cover the textbook Hebrew from Scratch vol. 1 from Lesson 3 through Lesson 17, and will be supplemented by additional written, audio, and video materials in Hebrew.</data>

Because this course explores a large swath of the history of Judaism, its peoples, and ideas in various geographic contexts, we will continually question the claim that there exists a single, static, essential entity called “Judaism.” Paying close attention to changes in Jewish religious and cultural self-understanding and traditions across primary and secondary texts, we will instead investigate the possibility that there were and are multiple “Judaisms” just as there were and are multiple “Jews” living in different cultural, religious, and geographic settings throughout time.</data>

This includes how various Native American cultures dealt with and adapted their views of these concepts in response to colonization. It also looks at how European/American settlers used gendered and sexualized notions of Native people to marginalize them in speeches, performances, and films including Disney’s Peter Pan and Pocahontas. The main goal of the course is to understand how different Native communities created their own understandings of gender and sexuality and how Native women defined their role in an ever-changing world. To do this, we will examine histories produced from a Native perspective ranging from oral histories to modern documentaries. Due to the overwhelming diversity within Native America, this course is not comprehensive.

      <data key="d0">Rochester’s history began long before the first permanent settlement in 1812 and was marked by a long and violent conflict between native peoples, the French and the British.   Wheat harvested in the Genesee Valley was ground into flour using the power of the Genesee River as it dropped 260 feet to Lake Ontario.   Transporting flour and other goods to New York City and other markets was difficult until the Erie Canal was completed in 1825.  The canal enabled an enormous migration of settlers moving west, and many chose to stay in Rochester.  The village became a city in 1834 with a vibrant and expanding mix of cultures that joined together to make Rochester a vibrant commercial and manufacturing center.  The Western Union Telegraph Company traces its roots to Rochester in 1851 and in 1853 eight local New York railroads merged to form the New York Central, whose tracks ran parallel to the Erie Canal.   In 1881 a local bank clerk, George Eastman, quit his job to devote his full attention to the business of photography and founded the Eastman Kodak Company.  The Haloid Photographic Company was founded in Rochester in 1906 and entered into an agreement with inventor Chester Carlson in 1946 that resulted in the introduction of the Xerox 914 plain paper copy machine in 1959 was adopted around the world.   Nevertheless, Rochester’s most famous residents are likely Frederick Douglass and Susan B. Anthony, who were instrumental in the struggle to expand civil rights to all Americans.  The local community, however, struggled to welcome the large numbers of African Americans who moved to Rochester after World War II.  Housing discrimination, white flight to the suburbs, and riots marked the 1960s, and the city today has one of the highest rates of child poverty in the country.  Nevertheless, the city has vibrant cultural and educational institutions that continue to attract talented newcomers.  In short, the history of Rochester has a bit of everything and students in the course are encouraged to study the entire experience of the community, including topics that may be new and frankly uncomfortable. </data>

The language these tribes spoke and wrote gives us the oldest witnesses of perhaps the most influential and widely-spoken language in the world today: English. In this class, we will learn to read the earliest records of English (c. 700-1100) by studying the grammar, vocabulary, and poetics of the period.

The course will move chronologically, and it will cover many of the major forms, movements, and artists integral to the history of popular music in the twentieth-century US. However, the purpose of the course is not to present a survey history of US popular music. Rather, we will study some of the key themes and ruptures in US social, economic, and political life in the twentieth century via close examinations of a limited number of specific styles, events, and prominent figures from this time period. How popular music both reflected and shaped relations of race, class, gender, sexuality, nationalism, and militarism in the United States will constitute the principle intellectual inquiry of the course.  Particular musical movements and styles that may receive particularly close attention include blues, vaudeville, jazz, “folk” music, rock and roll, country music, soul, disco, reggae, and hip-hop. </data>

Of particular interest throughout the term will be the hopes and anxieties, allegiances and resistances, aesthetic triumphs and political frustrations that characters American romantic artists and have made the imagination a crucial part of the nation's life and an indispensable resource for its people even at moments when fundamental conflicts threatened to end the nation altogether.</data>

From the Paris Commune to the Iron Curtain, the course explores the surprising varieties of socialist socieites that emerged in the 19th and 20th centuries. This course asks students to consider: how were these societies ruled and why did they fail? To what extent were they influenced by the political philosophies of the 19th century? To what extent were they a product of geo-political conflicts and the failures of capitalism in the 20th? How did socialist leaders and citizens imagine the future of socialist development?

In this course, we will consider how histories of race, racial conflict, and revolt in the United States—so key to the nation’s social structures and dominant myths—have been told and re-shaped by literature and film. The course will pay particular attention to the interaction between race and revolt in the narratives we study—how race shapes narratives of political and social revolt, and how these narratives of revolt in turn shape ideas about race.  Histories of Black revolt, indigenous wars and rebellions, immigrant rebellions in the US, and wars of US imperial aggression overseas will all receive attention. Additionally, the course will consider how US literature and film have dealt with rebellions with primarily white protagonists, and how these narratives have shaped and been shaped by racial structures and ideologies.  The course is ultimately concerned with how literature and film have shaped dominant understandings of who can and does participate in revolts, and why; and in turn, how these narratives have impacted the social and political struggles that follow in their wake.</data>

      <data key="d0">The idea of Central Europe, which originally had a strong German affiliation, is historically linked with the legacy of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. On a 21st-century map, Central Europe is made up of Austria, Czechia, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, and western Ukraine. After WW II most of Central Europe became a strategic part of the external Soviet empire, and all Central European countries experienced political oppression, economic underdevelopment, and social stagnation. Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary contributed to the final collapse of communist ideology in 1989-90 and collectively embarked on the path leading to full integration with the European Union. Russia's invasion of Ukraine and its implications, however, changed the political perspective of Central European countries. Poland and Hungary, once close allies, now view Russia's role differently, especially Moscow's imperial ambitions. Nationalism, authoritarianism, and illiberal democracy have become significant elements of the political message provided by mainstream parties, though many Central European politicians claim that the region is going through a "strategic awakening". This “strategic awakening” may have different interpretations, especially vis-à-vis Russia and Ukraine.   </data>

Emphasis is placed on both grammar and cultural information. Classes meet five times a week and combine language theory and practice. Each class is fifty minutes long. Students must sign up for both a MWF and a TR block.

In this course, we will explore three of the era's most remarkable works:Giorgio Bassani's The Gold-Rimmed Spectacles, Beppe Fenoglio's A Private Affair and Natalia Ginzburg's Family Lexicon.What distinguishes them are the unique lenses through which they recount history, offering glimpses of how love, in particular, becomes entangled in politics and war: in Bassani's story, a town ostracizes an older resident for his relationship with a young man during the rise of Fascism; in Fenoglio's tale, a partisan's memories of his beloved veer him off course during the Resistance; and in Ginzburg's account, a woman relates her antifascist Jewish family's trials and tribulations under dictatorship. To complement the novels, there will be a theoretical component to elaborate the issues of gender, sexuality and relationality.

This course considers the tangible object that is the source of the image onscreen, and the social, cultural, and historical value of a reel of film as an organic element with a finite life cycle. We focus on the analog photographic element and its origins (both theatrical and small gauge), the basics of photochemical film technology, and the state of film conservation and preservation worldwide. Guest lectures by staff of the Moving Image Department of George Eastman Museum provide a first-hand look at film preservation in action, allowing us to consider analog film as an ephemeral form of material culture: a multipurpose, visual record that is art, entertainment, evidentiary document, and historical artifact. Weekly film assignments. Class meets on River Campus and at George Eastman Museum (900 East Ave, no admission fee but students provide their own transportation). No audits, no pre-requisites.

We begin with the selection of a pen name and the carving of a soft stone stamp. From here, we will practice a variety of calligraphic styles, including kaisho (print script), gyosho (cursive style) and sosho (simplified cursive style) of kanji (Chinese characters). We will also learn the meanings of kanji. The course concludes with an exhibit of calligraphic artwork. For the cultural component of this class, we will study “graphology,” or how handwritten messages are read for meaning, in works of Japanese fiction, film, and manga. This course is ideal for those who have studied some calligraphy previously, but newcomers are also welcome. Likewise, previous study of Chinese or Japanese, while helpful, is not required.

One of the oldest languages in the world, for several centuries Hebrew was used only as a literary tool until it was revived as a national Jewish language starting in the late 19th century. Today, Hebrew is the official language of Israel and is studied and spoken by Jews and non-Jews all around the world. Used in everyday life, songs, films, and on the Internet, Hebrew has never been so young!This course is the direct continuation of HBRW 101 that is taught in the Fall. Emphasis is on further developing reading, writing, comprehension, and speaking skills, with a focus on cultural orientation and the practical use of Hebrew in meaningful everyday situations. During the semester, students will expand the basic language skills acquired in HBRW 101, enhance their understanding of Hebrew grammar constructions (in particular, verbs in the present and past tense, use of direct object and prepositional verbs, common syntactical constructions), and increase their vocabulary. The course will cover the textbook Hebrew from Scratch vol. 1 from Lesson 3 through Lesson 17, and will be supplemented by additional written, audio, and video materials in Hebrew.</data>

Designed for students with little or no prior knowledge of Judaism, it will examine the formation, ruptures, and changes of Jewish tradition, identity, and culture beginning with the Tanakh (the Hebrew Bible), continuing through Rabbinic interpretations of law and lore, medieval Jewish thought, early modern Jewish mysticism, the Enlightenment and modern Jewish philosophy, up to contemporary American Jewish feminism. Because this course explores a large swath of the history of Judaism, its peoples, and ideas in various geographic contexts, we will continually question the claim that there exists a single, static, essential entity called “Judaism.” Paying close attention to changes in Jewish religious and cultural self-understanding and traditions across primary and secondary texts, we will instead investigate the possibility that there were and are multiple “Judaisms” just as there were and are multiple “Jews” living in different cultural, religious, and geographic settings throughout time.</data>

      <data key="d0">Revolutions and Revolt is an experimental course that examines 20th century German cultural history. We will explore questions of social justice, representation, and political expression clustered around three major revolutionary moments: the German Revolution of 1918, the German Student Movement of 1968, and the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Our course will be oriented by a careful reading of Marx and Engle's Communist Manifesto, that, while also defining the conditions of possibility for an empowered proletarian class, can also be used a tool to reflect on the revolutionary features of language, poetry, and art. We will think about specific genres – the manifesto, the pamphlet, political theater, and film, as genres that calls or could call "revolution" into being. These historical hinge points (a term I am borrowing from Matt Christman) bring various emancipatory impulses into relief, beyond the history of class conflict described in the Communist Manifesto, and we will engage with pacificist, anti-fascist, feminist, and Jewish texts and artworks. This course is conducted in English, and our readings are English translations of German texts, but if students of German would like to work on original texts, these can be provided along with alternative assignments where German language practice might be implemented. </data>

The focus is how Jewish survivors and theologians respond to catastrophic suffering and reinvent Jewish tradition in the process. The central problem is theodicy (the justification of God in relation to suffering) and anti-theodicy (the refusal of religious thinkers to justify or accept the relation between God and suffering). Part 1 explores first- and second-generation survivors’ accounts of the Holocaust with attention to how trauma shapes memory and representation. We then read classical Jewish responses to catastrophic suffering, including Biblical and Rabbinic sources, and compare these to post-Holocaust accounts. Finally, we examine the theological writings of post-Holocaust thinkers and how they reject and reinvent traditional ideas about God, suffering, and Judaism.</data>

Topics include basic formal language theory, finite state phonological and morphological parsing, and syntactic parsing for context free grammars and mildly context sensitive formalisms.Students who have taken the CSC17X series should consult with the instructor prior to enrollment, since there is overlap with a subset of the technical material covered in those courses. Conversely, while it is possible to enter this course with no programming experience and do well, students new to programming may wish to take CSC161 or to attend a CIRC programming bootcamp prior to taking this course.</data>

They will systematically prepare elicitation sessions, organize their data, and learn how to write up short sketches of their findings. The final project is a chapter of a joint sketch grammar of the language, including annotated natural text.In contrast to the senior seminar, however, this course is designed for two terms, continuing in the fall term. Also, participants are required to have taken LIN270/470 as a prerequisite. Having a background in language documentation and data processing techniques, students in this class will focus more on collecting and annotating natural texts (stories, dialogues, experimental data) which is adding a documentary angle.</data>

      <data key="d0">This course centers on how a firm is funded, and on how financial management can help maximize the financial rewards to those who own the firm, while meeting the obligations of the firm to other stakeholders. The effect of timing on the value of cash flows is developed at length, and is applied to the valuation of bonds and stocks. Various facets of stocks and bonds are also introduced, and a brief overview of the stock market is presented. Cash flow concepts are then incorporated into a development of how investment opportunities are analyzed, which includes a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses associated with different analytical methods. The topics of capital market efficiency and portfolio theory are then discussed and tied in to the concept of what investors have sacrificed in order to invest in a firm. This, in turn, is tied in to which investments are worthwhile to a firm's owners. In covering this material, recent business examples and financial research will be featured to supplement the textbook.Prerequisites: ECON108 or equivalent and one statistics course.** If the section is full, please request the course here on UR Student and then email ugbusiness@rochester.edu to be added to the waitlist.

We begin with an overview of securities markets. We then study how to discount cash flows, especially for fixed income securities, and introduce the concept of arbitrage. The investment theory part starts from partial equilibrium (mean-variance analysis) and proceeds with general equilibrium (CAPM). We test it with the data, discuss factor models and anomalies, and use it to evaluate the efficiency of markets. We then study derivatives (options, forwards, futures and swaps). Replication strategies are used to price derivatives, and the binomial model of option pricing is derived. We conclude with the Black-Scholes formula.

The topic considers motion, deformation, flow, stresses, forces, and heat transfer as determined by the laws of mechanics. Those phenomena may occur in any materials — solids, fluids, or things in-between — that can be well-modeled as continuous, not discrete (meaning quantization effects are negligible). To handle this wide variety of phenomena and materials, we use the language of tensor mathematics, which we will build up at the beginning of the course. Applications to ongoing research of the instructor and students will be incorporated wherever possible. The course will include indicial notation and tensor analysis, concepts of stress, both Eulerian and Lagrangian descriptions of deformation and strain, conservation of mass, momentum, energy, angular momentum, and constitutive equations to describe material response.</data>

Modules to be offered in various years include: fundamentals of optics for AR/VR; AR/VR in the silicon; foundations of visual perception in the context of AR/VR; computer audition and acoustic rendering; measuring the human brain; deep learning and visual recognition for AR/VR; brain-computer interfacing in a virtual environment; 3D interfaces and interaction; AR/VR for collaborative education &amp; professional training. In Spring 2023, the following three modules will be offered: 1) Deep learning and visual recognition for AR/VR. (Prof. Chenliang Xu) Recent developments in deep learning have significantly advanced state-of-the-art visual recognition in problems such as object detection, activity recognition, and semantic segmentation. In this module, students will learn core concepts in deep learning, including convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks. They will receive hands-on experience using popular deep-learning libraries like PyTorch to build visual recognition algorithms for AR/VR systems. 2) Measuring the human brain. (Prof. Ross Maddox) This module will introduce students to studies of human brain function using non-invasive methods. It will focus on experimental paradigms and data analysis in the time and frequency domains. Neural encoding and decoding models and applications to brain-computer interfaces will also be discussed. The module will have a mixed format, with lectures and labs. Lab exercises will be based on analyzing real data from human subjects. 3) Professional encounters with leading AR/VR researchers. This module will involve a series of seminars and discussion sessions with leading AR/VR researchers from academia and industry.

Is torture morally permissible in the fight against terrorism? How far does our moral duty to aid distant strangers extend? We will also explore related general questions: Is it always possible for a good enough end to justify bad means? Are there objective facts about right or wrong, or is morality ultimately relative to cultures or times? Are there situations in which every available action is wrong?

      <data key="d0">In recent years, the U.S. legal system has been beset by claims of overcriminalization, racially discriminatory enforcement, and inadequate or unequal protection of individual civil rights. What should we make of these claims, and what, if anything, would be implied by their truth? In seeking to answer these questions, this course will examine the nature of the law and its enforcement. We will begin by discussing the issue of criminalization and whether the expansion of the criminal law is or is not problematic. From there, we will turn to the foundational questions of what, precisely, the law is, and what its connection to morality is or should be. Are we obligated to obey the law, and if so, why? Finally, we will ask whether it is possible for the law to remain neutral with regards to morality and politics, and whether the supposed “neutrality” of the law may itself be an instrument of oppression. If the legal system lacks the kind of neutrality that many legal theorists claim for it, what (if anything) does that license us (as citizens) to do? (Offered every spring)</data>

      <data key="d0">Democracy literally means "rule by the people." This seminar in political theory will explore various questions that this basic definition raises in the context of 20th-century American politics. What can we expect of "the people"? How, indeed, do we even envision "the people"? What is the role of communication, especially modern media, in creating and sustaining "the people"? How might we think about the ways in which power and communication intersect in modern democracies? In many respects this course is experimental. It aims to draw connections between texts and theorists that have not been made before. So we will be exploring new terrain. Students will learn what it means to think like a political theorist. Enrollment is restricted to first-year students - no exceptions. Grades will be based on class participation - given that this is a small seminar, be prepared to talk! - and several short papers (meaning about five pages each) on assigned topics that emerge from the readings and class discussion.

      <data key="d0">This course takes a systems-change approach to problems of environmental health and justice. It will provide students with a methodological, conceptual, and experiential foundation in addressing problems through policies, partnerships, and community engagement. We will closely examine several timely local issues such as subsistence fishing, climate adaptation, equitable transportation, and housing. For each major topic, students will engage in background research, practice diverse data collection strategies, interact with relevant community groups, and gain experience integrating multidisciplinary information. Students will also undertake a semester-long community engaged project to address an environmental justice issue of concern to a local organization. NOTE: This is a community-engaged class and will involve significant blocks of time in field work, trips, and guest speakers. To accommodate this, there is an extended "lab" session; this session is required and will take place on Thursday from 3:25 - 4:40. This class is designated as part of the Certificate of Achievement in Community-Engaged Learning.PRE-REQUISITES: PHLT 101, PHLT 116, or PHLT 102; or by permission of instructor for students with significant policy, community change, or environmental management background.</data>

This co-taught course is a collaborative ethnographic research project designed to examine how the presence of prisons in towns around Rochester reflects and shapes the political, economic, and cultural lives of those who live in the region. Students will be introduced to methods and practices of ethnography and conduct firsthand research on the cultural politics of prison towns. Through assigned reading, students will learn about the history, sociology, and cultural logics of Rochester and the wider region, and of mass incarceration. What does a prison mean for a person living near one? How does the presence of prisons shape peoples notions of justice, citizenship, and punishment? How do these nearby but largely invisible institutions shape the ways that we live in Rochester? Recommended prior courses: Introduction to Cultural Anthropology or Incarceration Nation</data>

The course begins by discussing normative considerations about what might constitute "good" public policy.

Through the workings of this elegant electrical and biological machine we are able to reason about other people’s unobservable thoughts, emotions, and intentions, make moral judgments, and communicate with others. How does the brain develop the ability to accomplish these tasks? What regions of the brain are involved and what computations do they perform? How is this neural machinery affected by the social environment and psychiatric illness? In this course, we will examine the latest research in human social neuroscience towards answering these and related questions.This is a social science course.Prerequisites: PSYC 101 or BCSC 110</data>

We will study the New Testament and the early Jesus movement within the wider context of Second Temple Judaism and the Greco-Roman world. Issues such as the development of the canon, the divisions with the Jesus Movement between Jews and Gentiles, the different understandings of the figure of Jesus, the conflicts which shaped the institutional development of the early church, and the conflict between Rome and the early church will receive particular attention and analysis. We will approach the texts of the New Testament as we would any other texts in antiquity, namely from an historical perspective. Students will be exposed to the traditional tools of biblical scholarship. No previous knowledge of the New Testament or of early Christianity is assumed.</data>

Because this course explores a large swath of the history of Judaism, its peoples, and ideas in various geographic contexts, we will continually question the claim that there exists a single, static, essential entity called “Judaism.” Paying close attention to changes in Jewish religious and cultural self-understanding and traditions across primary and secondary texts, we will instead investigate the possibility that there were and are multiple “Judaisms” just as there were and are multiple “Jews” living in different cultural, religious, and geographic settings throughout time.</data>

The fault lines of race, faith, and politics are exacerbated by a lack of understanding of how these identities become barriers to genuine conversation. Divisive sub-groups serve as echo chambers, cutting us off from talking across the divides.  “The Bridging the Gap program is designed to combat the toxic polarization in our country, give students the skills they need to find common ground across deep divides, solve problems in their communities, thrive in the workplace of the future, and support students in their own character formation journey” (Interfaith America, 2022). Through these direct engagements and experiences, this community engaged course will teach students how to truly listen, understand, be heard, and seek common ground without attempting to change minds or having to compromise deeply held values. This course will give students the tools to find areas of common ground, live in constructive tension, understand our shared humanity and solve pressing problems with those of different backgrounds and beliefs. This course is designed to bring together students from culturally, theologically, politically, and racially diverse backgrounds to create a brave space for courageous conversations and to understand and explore solutions to one of America’s most pressing social problems: The call to defund the police: redefining “public safety” and what police reform might look like as America continues to wrestle with structural racism. This course will offer classroom learning on dialogue skills across political, cultural, and experiential differences, with intensive skill building sessions to practice these dialogue skills during a mandatory weekend retreat from January 13-15, and site visits with a broad range of police and public safety and stakeholders from our campus, the City of Rochester, and the State of New York.  </data>

One of the primary aims of this course is to situate Africa not merely as a site for the reception of Islam and European modernity, but as an integral node in the development of Islamic and Western intellectual, political, and social histories. In addition, we will interrogate the Eurocentric ideas of modernity through its political, epistemological, ethical, technological, and gendered dimensions while also examining the emergence of Islamic modernities, i.e., ways of being Muslim and modern that grew out of encounters on the African continent. In the process, we will engage with issues of colonialism and the formation of nation-states and how those processes gave rise to contemporary geopolitical concerns on the continent. Finally, this course will consider the transnational aspects of Islam in African contexts through the intersecting histories of Islam in America and Africa engendered through the slave trade and transatlantic flows of people and knowledge, as well as African Muslim diasporas in Europe.</data>

The focus is how Jewish survivors and theologians respond to catastrophic suffering and reinvent Jewish tradition in the process. The central problem is theodicy (the justification of God in relation to suffering) and anti-theodicy (the refusal of religious thinkers to justify or accept the relation between God and suffering). Part 1 explores first- and second-generation survivors’ accounts of the Holocaust with attention to how trauma shapes memory and representation. We then read classical Jewish responses to catastrophic suffering, including Biblical and Rabbinic sources, and compare these to post-Holocaust accounts. Finally, we examine the theological writings of post-Holocaust thinkers and how they reject and reinvent traditional ideas about God, suffering, and Judaism.</data>

      <data key="d0">The objective of this course is to explore Russian Folklore in all the wealth and the variety of its forms. We will study Russian Folklore from different perspectives, such as its development in time and space; its social and economic dimensions in Russia; and the historical changes that it underwent. We will explore the full range of folkloric forms, from the riddle to ancient Russian rituals and beliefs to the jokes and folk songs which are an integral part of contemporary social networks and TV shows. Analysis of these narratives and behaviors will allow the students to familiarize themselves with Russian fairy tales and to find their way in the maze of patterns and meanings in the Russian magic world. We will study the oral, visual, musical and folk architectural heritage in contemporary Russia, as well as ways in which Russian Folklore is collected, documented and interpreted by scholars. </data>

      <data key="d0">Buildings are among the most public, visible, and long lived artifacts that a culture creates.  The built environment serves as both a repository of cultural information and exerts an influence that extends beyond the society that created it.  Architecture is art in a physical, three dimensional reality; it responds to the limitations of technology, design, and space while materializing ideals of aesthetics and beauty.  Famous designers, trained architects, anonymous craftspeople, and laypeople alike create architectural forms. This studio art course will introduce the ways in which we design, create, study, and convey architecture.  We will investigate practices of architectural design, history, building craft, and engineering in this class through lectures, research, in-class exercises, and thematic assignments.  The course will culminate with a fully realized design for a small building of your own invention.  This course will challenge you to recognize precedent forms and to create designs of your own, from sketch to 3D model making, that explore basic design elements.  Skills explored in this course can be used to gain a better understanding of the built world around us and pursue further studies in architecture.This course is open to all majors, and prior architecture study is not required.

Through the close reading of poetic, narrative, and dramatic texts alongside a selection of historical/archival documents, we will attempt to understand how and why characters (e.g., Don Juan) and historical figures (e.g., Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz) represent, challenge, and/or negotiate different subject positions. We will pay particular attention to how the discourses of class, gender, race, and religion influence both fictional texts and historical contexts. Other themes discussed will include: transvestism, prostitution, the body, courtly love, and love sickness.  In Spanish. Pre-requisite SPAN 200.</data>

      <data key="d0">The course will introduce the development of products under the FDAs CGMP (current good manufacturing practices) and the ISO 13485 standard for medical devices. The intent is to understand how to use these standards (or the ISO9000 standard for products other than medical devices) to develop products or research systems that meet requirements. The course will emphasize understanding customer and market requirements, which leads to a product requirements document (PRD), and proceeds through concept development, risk and failure analysis, industrial and human factors design considerations, design analysis and manufacturing considerations. The course also presents topics on scheduling, budgeting, patents and intellectual property management. Special note on mobile-app-only development: while app development is popular, the risks and the business models are very unique from a regular hardware-based product development. Therefore, this class will not cover the concepts of app development.</data>

George Orwell chose to critique Stalanism through animals in his aptly named novel Animal Farm. In The Dispossessed, Ursula K. Le Guin used the technology of science fiction to comment on cold war politics. While we will not read these specific authors, we will consider other varied manifestations of the allegory as a genre. Why are authors attracted to this form? What allows it to raise political or cultural questions? Through their writing, students will consider the lens of the allegorical form to engage with a diverse range of topics. At the same time, group discussion will be a place to consider the possibilities and limitations of the form itself. We will explore allegories through multiple genres from poetry, plays, and short stories like Nathaniel Hawthorne’s “Young Goodman Brown,” to visual media like television episodes of The Twilight Zone and Hayao Miyazaki’s Spirited Away. In responding to these works students will develop skills in academic writing and critical thinking.

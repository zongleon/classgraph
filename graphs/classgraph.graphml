Modules to be offered in various years include: fundamentals of optics for AR/VR; AR/VR in the silicon; foundations of visual perception in the context of AR/VR; computer audition and acoustic rendering; measuring the human brain; deep learning and visual recognition for AR/VR; brain-computer interfacing in a virtual environment; 3D interfaces and interaction; AR/VR for collaborative education &amp; professional training. In Spring 2023, the following three modules will be offered: 1) Deep learning and visual recognition for AR/VR. (Prof. Chenliang Xu) Recent developments in deep learning have significantly advanced state-of-the-art visual recognition in problems such as object detection, activity recognition, and semantic segmentation. In this module, students will learn core concepts in deep learning, including convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks. They will receive hands-on experience using popular deep-learning libraries like PyTorch to build visual recognition algorithms for AR/VR systems. 2) Measuring the human brain. (Prof. Ross Maddox) This module will introduce students to studies of human brain function using non-invasive methods. It will focus on experimental paradigms and data analysis in the time and frequency domains. Neural encoding and decoding models and applications to brain-computer interfaces will also be discussed. The module will have a mixed format, with lectures and labs. Lab exercises will be based on analyzing real data from human subjects. 3) Professional encounters with leading AR/VR researchers. This module will involve a series of seminars and discussion sessions with leading AR/VR researchers from academia and industry.

      <data key="d0">(4 credits, Fall, Spring) Chemistry 252 covers thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and chemical kinetics. These subjects provide a fundamental understanding of the behavior of matter and energy. The focus of the class is on both Thermodynamics, which is the mathematical theory of heat, gives rules describing how heat flows, and the relationship between heat and other kinds of energy, as well as on Statistical mechanics, which is the discipline that explains the nature of temperature, entropy, and provides a fundamental and microscopic explanation of thermodynamics in terms of probability and laws of statistics. The course follows the textbook “Molecular Thermodynamics” by D.A. McQuarrie and John Simon, and “Molecular Driving Force” by K.A. Dill and S. Bromberg.The course begins with the concept of Microstates and Entropy, the equal a priori probabilities assumption, the direction of approaching equilibrium as a process that maximizes the total number of microstates. It then discusses the nature of Temperature and uses heat transfer as an example to illustrate the process that maximizes the number of microstates. It continues with the derivation of the Boltzmann distribution and the physical meaning of partition function, followed by simple and concise applications of Boltzmann distribution. It then covers the factorization approximation, Translational Partition Function and Partition function of the monatomic ideal gas, obtaining energy and pressure from the partition function. It follows with the vibrational and rotational partition functions, and the intuitive understanding of heat capacities of solid and diatomic molecules. The course continues with the equipartition theorem of energy, and the concept of negative temperature. It then covers the Statistical Entropy, Entropy for model systems and detailed examples, Gibbs Entropy Formula and applications. For the Thermodynamics part of the class, it begins with the Basic logic of Thermodynamics, spontaneous processes, and the direction of approaching equilibrium. It continuous with the first law of Thermodynamics, Work, and Heat, The second law of Thermodynamics, and thermodynamics definition of Entropy, The third law of Thermodynamics, the Temperature dependence of Entropy, the concept of Enthalpy and its application in Thermochemistry. Then it follows with the Helmholtz Free energy, Gibbs Free Energy, Maxwell Relation and Gibbs-Helmholtz equation. The course then discusses the applications, focusing on Phase Equilibria, Chemical Potential, Gibbs-Duhem Equation, Solutions. It ends with the discussions of Chemical Equilibrium, Chemical Kinetics, Transition State Theory. The course also has peer-lead workshop sessions. In these sessions, students will work in teams and lead by workshop leaders to discuss concepts learned in lectures and solve problems that exemplify the concepts discussed in lecture material and explain their solutions to each other. Workshops help the students to engage with the material together with their peers.

      <data key="d0">This course teaches how to approach and solve a wide range of organizational design problems, whether as manager at any level, entrepreneur, or consultant. In a world in which most sources of competitive advantage are fleeting, organizational effectiveness has emerged as a key source of long-run competitive advantage. Conversely, many corporate failures can be traced to poor internal organization. Problems covered range from individual job design to the structure of entire organizations and the boundaries of the firm (e.g., M&amp;A decisions or vertical integration). The course discusses in detail the assignment of decision rights (including centralization vs. decentralization of decisions), performance measurement, and incentives and rewards. These are the three elements of “organizational architecture,” a central framework of the course. Throughout, the course stresses the importance of fit between a firm’s internal organization and its strategy. The course adopts an analytical-economic perspective that is grounded in the field of organizational economics. It also addresses the managerial and behavioral dimensions of organizational problems, drawing on insights from psychology and sociology as appropriate.First year and sophomore students are not eligible for this course.

      <data key="d0">While the term “copyediting” may be associated with journalism or literary fiction, in fact it is a vital component of the publication of almost any textual materials—from scholarly and popular publishing in arts and sciences to corporate and technical communications. So what do copy editors do? Is copyediting simply about enforcing rules of correctness? When is it okay to break those rules, or to allow others to do so, and what guides such decisions? How do copy editors understand and negotiate the relationships and interests of readers, writers, and the publications they work for? How has the information age changed the way copy editors think about and approach textual editing? In this class we will address both the principles and practices of copyediting. Students will learn the principles that guide copy editors, and then put these principles into use in a workshop setting, practicing copyediting in a variety of contexts, including digital communications.Prerequisite: Completion of the Primary Writing Requirement. </data>
